Lately I’ve been trying to switch up the music I listen to while coding. I still like the usual lofi playlists, but they were starting to feel a little stale. I randomly stumbled across Humano Studios on YouTube and it’s been my go-to ever since.

The music is super atmospheric and kind of cinematic, but still chill enough to focus. It’s not your typical study beats. If you’re looking for something a little different to zone in with, give it a shot. I’ve had it on almost every day this week.
