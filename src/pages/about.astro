    <div class="space-y-4 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10">
        <p>
            I'm a front-end engineer with over 10 years of professional
            experience building web apps, specializing in React (since the early
            days) and Next.js for the past five years.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey started in hackathons, where I met some incredible people
            and even co-founded a company together. We created Rocket Dept. to
            help people build MVPs for their startups and to build our own
            internal products in the IoT space.
        </p>
        <p>
            At MasterClass, I discovered my passion for front-end
            infrastructure, building libraries, tools, and patterns that help
            teams move faster and work more efficiently. I love the challenge of
            solving complex technical problems and scaling codebases to balance
            speed with maintainability.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a background in graphic design, I enjoy working on polished UIs
            just as much as optimizing developer workflows. For me, the best
            projects strike a balance between technical depth and creative
            expressionâ€”and that's what keeps me excited about building for the
            web.
